# Slop patterns (writing)

Use this as a checklist when cleaning up AI-sounding prose.

## High-signal deletes

- "In conclusion", "To summarize", "Overall"
- "It's important to note", "It's worth noting"
- "Let's dive in", "In today's world", "At its core"
- "This highlights/underscores/demonstrates"
- "Not only X, but also Y" (usually)
- "Robust", "seamless", "powerful", "transformative", "cutting-edge"
- "Various", "numerous", "a range of", "many" (when you can be specific)

## Vague claims

If the sentence is true but ungrounded, fix it:
- Add specifics (who/what/when/how much), or
- Rephrase as a narrower claim you can stand behind, or
- Delete it.

Red flags:
- "Experts say..."
- "Studies show..."
- "It's widely recognized..."
- Name-dropping outlets/brands without relevance

## Rhythm and structure

- Too many headings; headings that restate the first sentence.
- Over-bulleted paragraphs (especially "**Label:** sentence").
- Rule-of-three cadence everywhere ("speed, quality, and alignment").
- Repeated "However," / "Additionally," / "Moreover," per paragraph.

## Language cleanup

- Prefer "is/has" over "serves as/boasts/features" when it reads like brochure copy.
- Prefer one good term repeated over synonym cycling.
- Use contractions if the surrounding text is informal.
- Avoid hedging stacks ("could potentially possibly").

## Tone cleanup

- Remove chatbot artifacts ("Hope this helps", "Let me know if...").
- Avoid fake confidence; also avoid academic disclaimers unless needed.
- Be comfortable being blunt when it saves time.

## Final pass questions

- Would I believe a real person wrote this?
- Does every paragraph earn its space?
- Are there any claims that would get me embarrassed in a week?
