# Slop patterns (writing)

Quick checklist for removing AI-writing tells.

## Cut these (almost always)

- "In conclusion", "To summarize", "Overall"
- "It's important/worth noting..."
- "Let's dive in", "At its core", "In today's world"
- "This highlights/underscores/demonstrates"
- "Not only X, but also Y" (usually)

## Replace these with specifics

- "Experts say..."
- "Studies show..."
- "It's widely recognized..."
- "Many/numerous/various..." (when you can count or name)

## De-inflate the tone

- Swap "robust/seamless/powerful/transformative" for what it actually does.
- Prefer "is/has/does" over "serves as/boasts/features" when it reads like marketing.

## Reduce rhythm artifacts

- Too many headings.
- Over-bulleted paragraphs.
- "However/Additionally/Moreover" every paragraph.
- Synonym cycling instead of repeating the clearest term.
