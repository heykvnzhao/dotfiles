# Preferred voice

This is the default "house voice" for writing in this workspace.

## Core vibe

- Direct, not performative.
- Practical, not poetic.
- Confident, but not salesy.
- Specific enough that someone could verify it.

## Structure

- Lead with the point in 1-2 sentences.
- Short paragraphs. If a paragraph is doing two jobs, split it or delete one job.
- Use bullets for scanning, but don't turn everything into bullets.
- Make tradeoffs explicit: what this does, what it doesn't do, and why.

## Language

- Prefer plain verbs: "is/has/does" over "serves as/boasts/features" when it reads like brochure copy.
- Prefer concrete nouns over abstractions ("cache file" > "data layer").
- Use contractions if the surrounding text is informal.
- Repeat the best word rather than rotating synonyms.

Avoid:
- "In conclusion", "It's important to note", "Let's dive in"
- "Transformative", "seamless", "robust", "groundbreaking"
- "Experts say", "Studies show" (without specifics)

## Honesty knobs

- Name rough edges and shortcuts when they matter ("My fix is dumb but fast: ...").
- Don't pretend everything is solved. If it's a workaround, say it's a workaround.
- Avoid generic optimism ("the future looks bright"). Say what will happen next instead.

## A couple micro-examples

AI-ish:
- "This tool provides a seamless, powerful workflow for productivity."

Preferred:
- "This tool saves me a few minutes per episode. It's fast because it only reads local files."

AI-ish:
- "While details are limited, it could potentially be argued that..."

Preferred:
- "I'm not sure yet. If it breaks, the first thing I'll check is X."
