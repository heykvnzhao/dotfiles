# Writing Best Practices

Apply these rules any time you write or rewrite prose in this session.

## Defaults

- Punchline first, then details.
- Be specific. Prefer concrete nouns, numbers, names, and dates over vibes.
- Be candid about limitations and tradeoffs.
- Keep it tight: short paragraphs, minimal signposting, no generic conclusions.

For voice, read `references/preferred-voice.md` when needed.

## Workflow

### 1) Clarify the target

- What is this for? (README, PR, internal doc, public post, UI copy)
- Who is it for?
- What does "done" look like? (inform, persuade, get approval, document a workflow)

### 2) Draft like a human

- Start with the point (1-2 sentences).
- Add only the details that change someone's behavior or understanding.
- Use the simplest words that still feel precise.

### 3) Remove AI-writing tells

- Delete filler and stage directions ("Let's explore...", "In conclusion...").
- Replace inflated language with plain statements.
- Replace vague attributions with specifics or delete.
- Avoid list spam: use bullets when it improves scanning, not as a default.

If you need a checklist, use `references/slop-patterns.md`.

### 4) Tighten

- Cut redundant sentences.
- Merge paragraphs that say the same thing.
- Use headings only when they help navigation.

### 5) Ship with a next step

- End with what you want the reader to do (or what decision they should make) when appropriate.
