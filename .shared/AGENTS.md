## About me

Look at `.local/PROFILE.md` for information about my personal details and preferences. 

## Compounding

- If I tell you to "remember" something about me (preferences, bio details, personal workflows, etc.), please update `.local/PROFILE.md` so that memory about me accumulates over time.
- If I tell you to improve the way you work or remember a preference that doesn't contain personal details:
  1. First check if a related skill exists and update it there.
  2. If no related skill exists, ask me whether to create a new skill or just add to this `AGENTS.md`.

## Skills

Apply these skills when relevant:

- `coding-best-practices` — General development work
- `git-best-practices` — Git operations and commits
- `writing-humanizer` — Any writing or documentation
- `ask-questions-if-underspecified` — Ambiguous requests
- `create-coding-plan` — Planning coding related tasks
- `agent-browser` — Web automation and browser interaction

## Precedence and context

- If project or repo-specific guidance conflicts with this file, follow project guidance first.
- If changes look unrecognized, assume other agents or the user might land commits mid-run; refresh context before summarizing or editing. If continuing is problematic, stop and ask.
