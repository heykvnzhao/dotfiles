# Web UI Best Practices

When invoked generally, apply these opinionated constraints for building better interfaces and for any UI work in this conversation.

When invoked with a file specified (i.e. `web-ui-best-practices <file>`), review the file against all constraints below and output:

1. violations (quote the exact line/snippet)
2. why it matters (1 short sentence)
3. a concrete fix (code-level suggestion)

## Stack

- MUST use Tailwind CSS defaults unless custom values already exist or are explicitly requested
- MUST use `motion/react` (formerly `framer-motion`) when JavaScript animation is required
- SHOULD use `tw-animate-css` for entrance and micro-animations in Tailwind CSS
- MUST use `cn` utility (`clsx` + `tailwind-merge`) for class logic

## Components

- MUST use accessible component primitives for anything with keyboard or focus behavior (`Base UI`, `Radix`, `React-Aria`)
- MUST use the project’s existing component primitives first
- NEVER mix primitive systems within the same interaction surface
- SHOULD prefer [`Base UI`](https://base-ui.com/react/components) for new primitives if compatible with the stack
- MUST add an `aria-label` to icon-only buttons
- NEVER rebuild keyboard or focus behavior by hand unless explicitly requested

## Interaction

- MUST use an `AlertDialog` for destructive or irreversible actions
- SHOULD use structural skeletons for loading states
- NEVER use `h-screen`, use `h-dvh`
- MUST show errors next to where the action happens
- NEVER block paste in `input` or `textarea` elements

## Navigation & State

- SHOULD reflect UI state in the URL (filters, tabs, pagination, expanded panels via query params)
- MUST use `<a>` / `<Link>` for navigation (Cmd/Ctrl+click and middle-click should work)
- SHOULD deep-link stateful UI (if it uses `useState`, consider URL sync via `nuqs` or similar)
- MUST require confirmation or undo window for destructive actions (never immediate)

## Touch & Interaction

- SHOULD set `touch-action: manipulation` on tappable controls (prevents double-tap zoom delay)
- SHOULD set `-webkit-tap-highlight-color` intentionally
- MUST use `overscroll-behavior: contain` in modals/drawers/sheets
- SHOULD during drag: disable text selection, `inert` on dragged elements
- SHOULD use `autoFocus` sparingly (desktop only, single primary input; avoid on mobile)

## Animation

- NEVER add animation unless it is explicitly requested
- MUST animate only compositor props (`transform`, `opacity`)
- NEVER animate layout properties (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin`, `padding`)
- SHOULD avoid animating paint properties (`background`, `color`) except for small, local UI (text, icons)
- SHOULD use `ease-out` on entrance
- NEVER exceed `200ms` for interaction feedback
- MUST pause looping animations when off-screen
- SHOULD respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- NEVER introduce custom easing curves unless explicitly requested
- SHOULD avoid animating large images or full-screen surfaces
- SHOULD never `transition: all`—list properties explicitly
- SHOULD set correct `transform-origin`
- SHOULD have animations be interruptible—respond to user input mid-animation

## Typography

- MUST use `text-balance` for headings and `text-pretty` for body/paragraphs
- MUST use `tabular-nums` for data
- SHOULD use `truncate` or `line-clamp` for dense UI
- NEVER modify `letter-spacing` (`tracking-*`) unless explicitly requested
- SHOULD use `…` not `...`
- SHOULD use curly quotes `"` `"` not straight `"`
- SHOULD have non-breaking spaces: `10&nbsp;MB`, `⌘&nbsp;K`, brand names
- SHOULD have loading states end with `…`: `"Loading…"`, `"Saving…"`
- SHOULD use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for number columns/comparisons
- SHOULD have flex children need `min-w-0` to allow text truncation
- SHOULD handle empty states—don't render broken UI for empty strings/arrays
- SHOULD consider that user-generated input fields may have short, average, and very long inputs

## Layout

- MUST use a fixed `z-index` scale (no arbitrary `z-*`)
- SHOULD use `size-*` for square elements instead of `w-*` + `h-*`

## Safe Areas & Layout

- MUST respect `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for full-bleed layouts and fixed elements on notched devices
- SHOULD avoid unwanted scrollbars (use `overflow-x-hidden` on containers and fix overflow at the source)
- SHOULD prefer flex/grid over JS measurement for layout

## Dark Mode & Theming

- MUST set `color-scheme: dark` on `<html>` for dark themes (fixes scrollbars and native inputs)
- SHOULD set `<meta name="theme-color">` to match the page background
- SHOULD set explicit `background-color` and `color` on native `<select>` (Windows dark mode)

## Locale & i18n

- MUST use `Intl.DateTimeFormat` (no hardcoded date/time formats)
- MUST use `Intl.NumberFormat` (no hardcoded number/currency formats)
- SHOULD detect language via `Accept-Language` / `navigator.languages`, not IP

## Hydration Safety

- MUST provide `onChange` for inputs with `value` (or use `defaultValue` for uncontrolled inputs)
- MUST guard date/time rendering against hydration mismatches (server vs client)
- SHOULD use `suppressHydrationWarning` only where truly needed

## Hover & Interactive States

- SHOULD provide `hover:` states for buttons/links (visual feedback)
- SHOULD increase contrast for interactive states (hover/active/focus more prominent than rest)

## Images

- MUST set explicit `width` and `height` on `<img>` (prevents CLS)
- SHOULD set `loading="lazy"` for below-fold images
- SHOULD set `priority` or `fetchpriority="high"` for above-fold critical images

## Performance

- NEVER animate large `blur()` or `backdrop-filter` surfaces
- NEVER apply `will-change` outside an active animation
- NEVER use `useEffect` for anything that can be expressed as render logic
- SHOULD virtualize large lists (>50 items) (e.g. `virtua` or `content-visibility: auto` where appropriate)
- MUST avoid layout reads during render (`getBoundingClientRect`, `offsetHeight`, `offsetWidth`, `scrollTop`)
- SHOULD batch DOM reads/writes (avoid interleaving)
- SHOULD prefer uncontrolled inputs; controlled inputs must be cheap per keystroke
- SHOULD add `<link rel="preconnect">` for CDN/asset domains
- SHOULD preload critical fonts (`<link rel="preload" as="font">`) and use `font-display: swap`

## Design

- NEVER use gradients unless explicitly requested
- NEVER use purple or multicolor gradients
- NEVER use glow effects as primary affordances
- SHOULD use Tailwind CSS default shadow scale unless explicitly requested
- MUST give empty states one clear next action
- SHOULD limit accent color usage to one per view
- SHOULD use existing theme or Tailwind CSS color tokens before introducing new ones

## Design Direction (when aesthetics requested)

- MUST choose a clear aesthetic direction and execute consistently (e.g., brutally minimal, editorial, utilitarian, playful)
- SHOULD use deliberate typography (1 display + 1 body) and avoid accidental defaults; follow product font system when it exists
- SHOULD define theme/palette via CSS variables; use one dominant base + sharp accent
- SHOULD match implementation complexity to the aesthetic (minimal = restraint; maximal = elaborate but controlled)
- If motion is explicitly requested: prefer one cohesive high-impact sequence (load stagger, scroll reveal) over scattered micro-interactions
- SHOULD avoid cookie-cutter layout/component patterns; make 1-2 distinctive choices grounded in context

## Content & Copy

- SHOULD use active voice ("Install the CLI" not "The CLI will be installed")
- SHOULD use specific button labels ("Save API Key" not "Continue")
- SHOULD write error messages with a fix/next step, not just the problem
- SHOULD write in second person; avoid first person
- SHOULD use `&` over "and" where space-constrained

## Anti-patterns (flag these)

- `user-scalable=no` or `maximum-scale=1` disabling zoom
- `onPaste` with `preventDefault`
- `transition: all`
- `outline-none` without a `focus-visible` replacement
- Inline `onClick` navigation without `<a>` / `<Link>`
- `<div>` / `<span>` with click handlers (use `<button>`)
- Images without dimensions
- Large arrays `.map()` without virtualization
- Form inputs without labels
- Icon buttons without `aria-label`
- Hardcoded date/number formats (use `Intl.*`)
- `autoFocus` without clear justification

## Rules if not found in primitives

The below rules apply if the pattern is either explicitly requested or not found in the primitive itself already.

### Accessibility

- Icon-only buttons need `aria-label`
- Form controls need `<label>` or `aria-label`
- Interactive elements need keyboard handlers (`onKeyDown`/`onKeyUp`)
- `<button>` for actions, `<a>`/`<Link>` for navigation (not `<div onClick>`)
- Images need `alt` (or `alt=""` if decorative)
- Decorative icons need `aria-hidden="true"`
- Async updates (toasts, validation) need `aria-live="polite"`
- Use semantic HTML (`<button>`, `<a>`, `<label>`, `<table>`) before ARIA
- Headings hierarchical `<h1>`–`<h6>`; include skip link for main content
- `scroll-margin-top` on heading anchors

### Focus States

- Interactive elements need visible focus: `focus-visible:ring-*` or equivalent
- Never `outline-none` / `outline: none` without focus replacement
- Use `:focus-visible` over `:focus` (avoid focus ring on click)
- Group focus with `:focus-within` for compound controls

### Forms

- Inputs need `autocomplete` and meaningful `name`
- Use correct `type` (`email`, `tel`, `url`, `number`) and `inputmode`
- Never block paste (`onPaste` + `preventDefault`)
- Labels clickable (`htmlFor` or wrapping control)
- Disable spellcheck on emails, codes, usernames (`spellCheck={false}`)
- Checkboxes/radios: label + control share single hit target (no dead zones)
- Submit button stays enabled until request starts; spinner during request
- Errors inline next to fields; focus first error on submit
- Placeholders end with `…` and show example pattern
- `autocomplete="off"` on non-auth fields to avoid password manager triggers
- Warn before navigation with unsaved changes (`beforeunload` or router guard)
